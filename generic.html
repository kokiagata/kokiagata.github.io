							<h1 id='story'>My Story</h1>
							<p>Although my background has nothing to do with computer science or coding for that matter, I have always loved building things with my own hands. One of my most favorite classes from my childhood was "craft" class where I had opportunities to create things from scratch and solely based on imagination. I had many craft projects over many summers, and although those were "assignment", I remember having always enjoyed doing those "assignment". Never have I ever thought that computer science was a place where I can create things, and contribute to building things with others, for other people.</p>
							<p>I felt as though I was always "lost", trying to find something that I can be passionate about. Havng moved from Japan to Kansas City in 2020, I was looking for a new start to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to start afresh. And that is when I discovered coding, and how it gives me the chance to be creativite and the opportunities to create things with my own hands. I was hooked. I was also surprised how needed and wanted the programming skills are here in the US, as opposed to Japan. It was only a little less than a year ago (as of May 2021) when I started my journey, but I learned many great things and how to code to build things. There were difficult times where I struggled a lot, trying to figure out why the many features I was trying to implement were not working, but I stuck with it. I stuck with it because at the end of the day, I have always been enthusiastic about coding and it made me feel accomplished.</p>
							<p>As you can see from my projects above and more, my focus was on JavaScript. I can now create things using both front-end and back-end JavaScript. After almsot a year of struggling as a self-taught programmer trying not to punch myself, I am now capable of using node JS, express JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and many more middlewares that allowed me to build apps that I showcase above. I also have some experience with JQuery, which I needed to learn to create my investment calculator. I have realized that more I code, it also gets easier to learn other languages, thus I am thrilled to have opportunities to learn even more languages to expand my exptertise and grow professionally. These projects and my consistent attempts to learn how to code should demonstrate my ability to learn things on my own, and problem solve without having any type of mentorship, and with my own skills.</p>
